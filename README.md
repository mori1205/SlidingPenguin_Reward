[日本語版README](https://github.com/open-video-game-library/SlidingPenguin/blob/main/README.JP.md)

SlidingPenguin is a driving game of penguin.

Control a penguin on ice and aim for the goal without falling into the sea.

The stage is slippery and moves forward automatically. Use left, right, up, down movements and acceleration to control the penguin without ending the game.

Designed for ease of understanding and experimentation, this game can be experienced with minimal input.

### Research Usage Examples

Game Experience Subjective Evaluation Study:

Controller Device Proposal Study:
